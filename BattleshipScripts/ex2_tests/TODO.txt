Add to code review: 
1. see if copy/assignment blocking in destructor for next time
2. all 0 point reductions
3. (AI)- Missing a user defined constructor because of uninitialized data members
	* see if there are more non informative comments and add them to the code review
4. deleted a static allocation
5. next time C-style cast used instead of a C++ cast - will take off points
6. explain OOP bad/medium/light - give example
